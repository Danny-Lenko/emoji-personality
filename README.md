## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup


### What I learned


1) easy method to fetch value from an input field

```js
document.getElementById('textbox_id').value;
// For example
document.getElementById("searchTxt").value;
```

2) ways to verically align content (link to the article in useful resources);


### Continued development

* CSS grid;


*Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
